title:  Ten guidelines for effective data visualization in scientific publications
author: Sean Anderson
---

I just stumbled on [this excellent recent
paper](http://scholar.google.ca/scholar?q=Ten+guidelines+for+effective+data+visualization+in+scientific+publications)
covering "guidelines for effective data visualization in scientific
publications". It's succinct and formalizes much of the common bits of advice
that get thrown around the lab. I particularly like that their entire paper can
be understood via their figures!
