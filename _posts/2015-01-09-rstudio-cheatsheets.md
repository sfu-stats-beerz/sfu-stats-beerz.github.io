title:  RStudio data wrangling cheatsheets
author: Sean Anderson
---

If you haven't seen them, RStudio has a series of [great PDF cheatsheets](http://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) available.

Current topics are 'data wrangling' (mostly dplyr, tidyr, and pipes), R Markdown, and Shiny. The new data wrangling one, in particular, is phenomenal. Especially if you're already a bit familiar with dplyr through, say, the workshop from last semester.

We should do another one on tidyr (it mostly replaced reshape2), joins in dplyr, and the bevy of new super-useful functions Hadley and Romain Francois have been adding to dplyr. Oh and dig more into magrittr pipes, which continue to revolutionize the R world.

If you've drunk the Kool-Aid, get your magrittr R pipes shirt [here](http://www.rstudio.com/about/gear/), and join all the cool kids.
