title:  AIC vs BIC model selection
author: Amanda Kissel and Sean Anderson

The difference between AIC and BIC came up in stats beerz this week. Here's a brief overview from [Sean Anderson](http://seananderson.ca/blog.html) from several months ago: 

I'm pretty sure you could write a novel on this topic. In times
like that, I like to ask WWBBD or 'what would Ben Bolker do?'

See [his book](http://ms.mcmaster.ca/~bolker/emdbook/book.pdf), starting on page 277

Also, see this short [blog post](http://emdbolker.wikidot.com/blog:aic-vs-bic) he wrote a while back:

AIC is by far the most common information criteria. Certainly in ecology.
[This paper](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/13-1452.1/full) by Aho et al. (2014) found that 84% of papers that used information criteria used
AIC and only 14% used BIC (also a good read and more than you probably want
to know).

One important thing here, besides the slightly different formulas for
AIC and BIC, is that AIC and BIC try to answer different questions.
AIC seeks to find the most parsimonious model. In other words, it
tries to maximize predictive accuracy. BIC tries to find the 'true'
model. In other words, if the 'true' model was among the models
considered and as sample size increases, BIC should correctly rank the
'true' model as the best model. A bit hard to wrap your mind around,
yes. I think ecologists may tend to focus more on what AIC aims to
answer. That's essentially Ben's conclusion.
