# Culturomics and linguistic analysis:

A neat paper based on Google Books:
"Quantitative Analysis of Culture Using Millions of Digitized Books"

# False positives/negatives

ROC curves, specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, error rates, etc.:
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic>

Andrew Gelman on why we should be more focussed on Type S (sign) errors and Type M errors (magnitude -- which are more likely to happen with underpowered analyses) than Type 1 and 2 errors:

# GAMs

R packages for GAMs:

mgcv is the main package:
<http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mgcv/index.html>

To use lme4 as the random effect backend to GAMs:
<http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gamm4/index.html>
